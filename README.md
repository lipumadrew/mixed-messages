# mixed-messages

##Description
This script file contains a rudimentary random message generator. There are several message templates, and each one is randomly selected. Within each template, random words will be selected from a dictionary object containing various parts of speech. Many of these are Halloween-themed, and the results can be quite silly. I included a pronoun generator which will generate pronouns based on the person word being used in the template. Gender-neutral person words have a fifty-fifty chance of being masculine or feminine. In addition, there is a 1 in 10 chance that the pronoun will be gender-neutral regardless of which word is being used.

##Use
Simply run the file, and a random message will be printed to the console.
